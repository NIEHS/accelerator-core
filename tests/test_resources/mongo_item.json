It is designed for researchers, decision-makers, and the public to help better understand the interaction of complex events that cause landslides. The data, available from the datasets and tools provided, include information about past landslides, erosion, and fluvial processes in sloped areas. It includes data from various agency members of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites. The information is used to help monitor and mitigate landslide hazards.",
