# accelerator-core
Core libraries and classes for accelerator metadata backbone

## Description

This project is the base python package and libraries for the core of the Accellerator Project


![System Whiteboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2b07fa-bbed-454c-9050-73eccb7cbf6c)

The project implements all of the core components (accession, dissemination) and provides abstract superclasses and supporting code for all of the source and dissemination components. Addtional tools for test development, etc can be placed here but should be incorporated into specific projects as a python import

Each source and disseination target should be developed in a separate accelerator-source-xxx or accelerator-dissemination-xxx repository
